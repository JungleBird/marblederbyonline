This is a project I started to learn how to use open-source javascript libraries (three.js, react-three/fiber) to create a real-time multi-player game environment. 
Creating this has been a big learning experience; unlike a typical end-user application, this kind of multiplayer project requires a lot of networking code to syncronize many parallel, simultaneous player states.
This game uses a purely javascript stack (React/Node.js) to handle the logic and communication between the client and server.

I wanted to give all the marble-enthusiasts of the world a place to settle down and roll around in, as there are many, many people who take up marble-ing as a hobby. 
This kind of marble environment can have endless applications, from just having fun playing marble-soccer or creating and exploring an endless amount of possible worlds.
